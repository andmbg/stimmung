Use the mouse to draw a box around the dissenting votes at the top or bottom.
For example, by marking the votes of one or more MPs at the bottom, you can see them at the top in the context of the overall votes, i.e., whether this was an isolated dissenting vote or a major split in the parliamentary group.

Selections above and below act simultaneously by restricting each other (overlap or *intersect* in set theory).
You can expand or collapse the selection in a figure using the Shift or Alt key.
Double-clicking removes the selection.
