# Voting behavior in the Bundestag

*If monolithic parliamentary groups simply voted according to their size on every bill, debates would be quite pointless. Every now and then, MPs feel that their conscience or the platform on which they stood suggests a different position on a bill than the majority opinion in their parliamentary group. We are therefore looking at the voting behavior of members of the Bundestag. On the one hand, our question is: How often do members of a parliamentary group vote along party lines or against?*
